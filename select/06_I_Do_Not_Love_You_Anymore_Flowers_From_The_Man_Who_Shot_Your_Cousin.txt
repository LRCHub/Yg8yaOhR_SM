It was all fake
A long and steep mistake
Like a dream from which we wake
With nothing in our plate
And no words while our worlds quake

Why do you come around my door?
I do not love you anymore
And all the rings, the wedding bells
I gave them all to someone else

It was all you
I never had a clue
Until you drifted from my view
Our happy storm is through
What's left rusts it's broke bust and bruised

Why do you leave notes at my door?
I do not love you anymore
The things you said I did so well
I did them all to someone else

And I know grace
I've seen it's ugly face
Hidden in a lonely place
With lonely gauze and lace
The old joy, the old coy embrace

Why do you dress up like a whore?
I do not love you anymore
And all the lies you said I told
I have none left to ease your load
You know damn well what is in store
I do not love you anymore
