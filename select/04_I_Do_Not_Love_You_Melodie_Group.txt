You make me nervous each time you smile
You call me names and you make me cry
Say nasty things that confuse my mind
I don't know why you are so unkind
But I do not not love you

I let you in to my lonely life
Give you the hammer, give you a knife
I show you where you should aim the cut
I'll shout out when it hurts too much
But I do not not love you

I do not not love you

I do not not love you
I do not not love you
I do not not love you
I do not not love you
I do not not love you
I do not not love you
